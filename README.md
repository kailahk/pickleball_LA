# Pickleball LA

#### Pickleball LA is a Full-stack CRUD (create, read, update, delete) Web Application made using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The app enables users to login using Google OAuth, browse a list of verified pickleball courts in Los Angeles, and view further details about each individual court including reviews that users have posted. Each review shows which user posted the review and when, and also allows users who post reviews to edit and delete the ones they posted. The app enables users to reserve any court from the list at a specific day and time, as well as delete reservations if the time no longer works with the user's schedule. Pickleball LA was created out of a love for pickleball and an observation about the lack of structure (and resulting long wait times) that players experience in large cities like LA.

## Future Upgrades
* AAU, I want to be able to add courts.

* AAU, when I click on the 'add a review' form, I want my review to be added to the list of reviews on the details page for the associated court so that I can view my reservations and the court details simultaneously.
* AAU, when I view the details page to add a review of a specific court, I want to be able to upload photos along with my review to help inform others' decisions about where to play.
* AAU, I want to see the custom favicon on all pages
